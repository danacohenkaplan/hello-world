# Hello, world!
Second Commit

List of commands I have learned in Git
- git add <file name> adds a file to the staging area
- mkdir <directory name> makes a new directory
- cd <directory name> navigates into that directory
- git init initializes 
- git status tells us the status of our project
- git commit -m "Message" commits/saves a change with a message about what it is
